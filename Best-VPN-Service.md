##<a href="https://indepthworld.com/expressvpn-review-is-it-a-reliable-and-fast-vpn-provider/">ExpressVPN</a>

ExpressVPN is a VPN service that offers a great all-round experience. It has apps for all major platforms, and is one of the fastest VPNs around. It has a large number of servers, and they are located in over 90 countries.

On top of this it provides strong encryption, so you can rest assured that nobody will be able to snoop on your internet activity even if they have access to your PC or smartphone. The company also keeps no logs whatsoever; meaning it won’t be able to hand over any information about you or what you do online if somebody asks it too!

##IPVanish

IPVanish is a US-based VPN provider that offers more than 850 servers in 60 countries. IPVanish has apps for all major platforms, including Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and Linux. It also allows P2P traffic on all of its servers (with a few exceptions).

IPVanish is based in the United States and has a zero logs policy. This means that it does not collect any information about users' online activity or browsing history when they use their service. The company also claims to have strong encryption and offer military-grade security features to protect users from hackers trying to steal sensitive data from them when connected to the internet via their VPN server.

##Hotspot Shield

Hotspot Shield is one of the most popular and well-respected VPNs on the market. It offers a free version, but it's limited to 500MB per day and 2GB per month.

If you'd like more data or want to opt for a premium plan, Hotspot Shield offers an affordable paid service that delivers plenty of features without any nasty surprises. In addition to unlimited bandwidth and no throttling or bandwidth caps (data capping), Hotspot Shield has fast servers in over 20 countries with multiple server locations in each country. The app also includes malware protection and ad blocking as standard features, along with antivirus software that protects your PC from viruses, trojans, worms, spyware and other threats while you're connected to public WiFi networks..

Private Internet Access (PIA)

Private Internet Access (PIA) is a VPN service that is based in the US, but has over 3,000 servers in 25 countries. It has a strict no-logging policy and uses shared IPs instead of assigning you an individual one. PIA provides DNS leak protection and killswitch features to keep your browsing private and secure.

PIA works for all major platforms including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS devices as well as Fire TV Stick or other Roku boxes with an app for each platform on their website.

##ProtonVPN

ProtonVPN is a VPN service that is based in Switzerland. ProtonVPN's servers are located in 14 countries around the world. The company has a strict no logs policy and they also have a free tier of service that allows you to use their VPN for three hours at a time.

The interface of the ProtonVPN app is one of its best features, as it's easy to use and intuitive even for new users who are not familiar with VPNs or other security tools.

##VyprVPN

VyprVPN is a Switzerland-based VPN service that offers strong privacy protections, a good range of apps, and excellent speeds. It's not the fastest option on this list (though it does provide decent speeds for most people), but it's one of the best VPNs for streaming Netflix thanks to its vast server network. With over 700 servers in 70+ countries worldwide, you can easily find an uncrowded server with low latency to stream HD video reliably.

The company keeps no logs of your activity or connection data—a common privacy policy among VPN providers—and has been independently audited by a third party to confirm that it doesn't monitor users' web traffic or metadata either. This makes VyprVPN well-suited for torrenting and P2P file sharing as well as more mainstream uses like browsing websites or watching videos online anonymously while traveling internationally.

##TunnelBear

TunnelBear is a popular VPN service that has a free version. It’s great for those who want to try out a VPN before they commit to paying for one.

TunnelBear also has an iOS app and Android app, so you can use their VPN on your phone or tablet as well as on your computer. The interface of the apps is very easy to use, even for beginners.

Tunnelbear offers servers in the US and Europe (Germany, France and Canada). They also offer various additional features like ad blocking with Ghostery browser extension if you sign up for a paid plan which we recommend doing because it’s really cheap!
